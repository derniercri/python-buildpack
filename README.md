# Buildpack: Python

This is the official [Scalingo buildpack](https://doc.scalingo.com/buildpacks) for Python apps, powered by [Pipenv](http://docs.pipenv.org/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/) and other excellent software.

Recommended web frameworks include **Django** and **Flask**, among others. The recommended webserver is **Gunicorn**. There are no restrictions around what software can be used (as long as it's pip-installable). Web processes must bind to `$PORT`, and only the HTTP protocol is permitted for incoming connections.

Python packages with C dependencies that are not [available on the base image](https://doc.scalingo.com/platform/internals/base-docker-image#top-of-page) are generally not supported, unless `manylinux` wheels are provided by the package maintainers (common).

A `requirements.txt` must be present at the root of your application's repository to deploy.

See it in Action with Pipenv

Deploying a Python application couldn't be easier:

    $ ls
    Pipfile		Pipfile.lock	Procfile	web.py

    $ scalingo create my-python-app

    $ git push scalingo master

    -----> Python app detected

           ...
           Installing dependencies from Pipfile…
    -----> Discovering process types
           Procfile declares types -> (none)

A `Pipfile` and a `Pipfile.lock` must be present at the root of your application's repository.

Current default Python Runtime: Python 3.6.12

Specify a Buildpack Version
